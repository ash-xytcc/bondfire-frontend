      <p>Dual Power West is a gathering for learning, sharing, building, and reflection across anti authoritarian and anti capitalist movements.</p>
      <p>We are building a space for trust, skill sharing, solidarity, and collective exploration. The point is not polished conference culture. The point is relationships, courage, and practical capacity.</p>
      <p>This public site is the front door. Organizer tools, internal logistics, and planning live behind sign in.</p>

      <p><strong>What is Dual Power?</strong></p>
      <p>Dual power is the project of building self determination, mutual aid, solidarity, and direct democracy in our communities by creating spaces that empower us all and from which new emancipatory institutions can emerge.</p>

      <p><strong>Who is organizing Dual Power West?</strong></p>
      <p>Dual Power West is an autonomous event being organized by a developing network of tenants, workers, and activists participating in Symbiosis Federation, Autonomous Tenants Union Network, the Industrial Workers of the World, and independent dual power projects across the country. We are not affiliated with any political party.</p>

      <p><strong>Why do we think this is important?</strong></p>
      <p>We come together from across the spectrum of anti-authoritarian and anti-capitalist tendencies, traditions, and organizations. We want a space where people can build trusting relationships, construct bridges, share ideas, and strengthen each other.</p>

      <p><strong>What kind of event is this?</strong></p>
      <p>The gathering uses an unconference structure. That means participants help create the agenda, shape sessions, and bring their own ideas, skills, and questions into the space.</p>

      <p><strong>Will it be child friendly?</strong></p>
      <p>Several core organizers have children and they will be part of the event. Child-friendly planning is part of the event culture, not an afterthought.</p>

      <p><strong>What happens after the gathering?</strong></p>
      <p>We are not imposing a predetermined outcome. What comes next will be defined locally, and the networks built through the gathering will help inform, grow, and articulate the movements that emerge from it.</p>
